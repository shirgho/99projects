* P02 - Regex query tool
** Project
Regex Query Tool - A tool that allows the user to enter a text string and then 
in a separate control enter a regex pattern. It will run the regular expression 
against the source text and return any matches or flag errors in the regular expression.
** Strategy
For this, I want to make a small web interface.
+ one text area for the input (OPTIONAL : upload file)
+ one text area for the regex pattern
+ result displayed using CSS for text-coloring
** Features
*** DONE handle regex errors
** What I learned
+ handling exceptions
